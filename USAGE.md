### Overview

The CNTI Test Suite can be run in production mode (using an executable) or in developer mode (using [crystal lang directly](INSTALL.md#source-install)). See the [pseudo code documentation](PSEUDO-CODE.md) for examples of how the internals of WIP tests might work.

### Syntax for running any of the tests

```
# Production mode
./cnti-testsuite [options] <task> [<task> ...]

# Developer mode
crystal src/cnti-testsuite.cr -- [options] <task> [<task> ...]
```

Options are GNU-style and may appear anywhere on the line, as `--name VALUE`
or `--name=VALUE`; several task names run in order. `--skip <task>` leaves a
task out of a suite. `./cnti-testsuite help` lists every option; an unknown
option or task is a usage error (exit 64) with the closest match suggested.

```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_install --cnf-config ./cnti-testsuite.yaml --timeout 120
./cnti-testsuite all --skip resilience --strict
./cnti-testsuite liveness readiness
```

:star: \*Note: All usage commands in this document will use the production (binary executable) syntax unless otherwise stated.

### Results Output

Every run prints a per-test line to stdout **and** writes a full results file.

#### On stdout

- :heavy_check_mark: **PASSED** — the test met best practice; points awarded.
- :x: **FAILED** — the test failed; no points.
- ⏭ **SKIPPED** — the test was not executed (a reason is printed); no points.
- ⏭ **N/A** — the test does not apply to this CNF (the feature under test is absent); excluded from scoring.
- 💥 **ERROR** — the test errored while running.

Failed/errored tests also print indented detail lines beneath the result:
`> impacted: <resource>`, `> remediation: <guidance>`, and free-form `> <note>` lines.

#### Results file

Each run writes a **timestamped YAML file** into the results directory — `cnti/results/` under the
current working directory unless redirected (see below):

```
cnti/results/cnti-testsuite-results-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm>.yml
```

A new file is created per run, and **`cnti/results/latest.yml` always points at the newest one** — a
relative symlink, repointed whenever a results file is created (a copy, kept current, on
filesystems without symlinks). Scripts should read `latest.yml` rather than sorting the
directory. Every run also ends with one stable line naming both paths:

```
Results: cnti/results/cnti-testsuite-results-<timestamp>.yml (latest: cnti/results/latest.yml)
```

To write somewhere else, pass `--results-dir PATH` on the command line or set the
`CNTI_TESTSUITE_RESULTS_DIR` environment variable; the option wins over the variable. The
timestamped file and `latest.yml` both go there, and `delete_results` honours the same setting.

The file is rewritten after every test. While the run is in progress it says `status: running`
and `exit_code: null`; the verdict is written only when the run ends (or stops on `--strict`).
A file still in the `running` state therefore belongs to a run that did not finish — a crash,
a kill, a CI timeout — and its `summary` shows only what had run by then.

A machine-readable [JSON Schema](docs/cnti-testsuite-results.schema.json) describes the file
(matching the current `schema_version`); use it to validate output or generate types.

##### Top-level fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Always `cnti testsuite`. |
| `testsuite_version` | Version of the test suite that produced the file. |
| `schema_version` | Integer version of this results-file schema; bumped on breaking changes. |
| `status` | Overall run verdict, derived from `exit_code`: `passed` (0), `failed` (1), `error` (2); `running` until the run ends. |
| `command` | The command line that produced this file. |
| `exit_code` | Process exit code, answering "did this run meet its objective?" (`null` while the run is in progress). `2` at least one test errored (raised) - the suite itself broke, which always wins. Otherwise, for a run with a pass criterion (`cert`): `0` the criterion was met, `1` it was not. For a run without one (`all`, `workload`, `platform`): `0` no test failed (passed/skipped/na), `1` at least one test failed. Additionally, the process exits with `64` (usage error) on unknown or malformed command-line arguments, before any test runs. See [Exit codes](#exit-codes) for the full table. |
| `summary` | Aggregate numbers for the whole run (see below). |
| `items` | One entry per test that ran (see below). |

##### `summary` fields

All counts/scores are scoped to the tests that actually ran.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `total` | Number of tests executed. |
| `passed` / `failed` / `skipped` / `na` / `error` | Count of items in each status. |
| `max_passed` | Maximum number of tests that could have passed (denominator for "X of Y tests passed"). |
| `essential_passed` / `essential_max_passed` | Passed vs. maximum-passable among `essential`-tagged tests. |
| `points` | Total points scored. |
| `maximum_points` | Maximum points achievable by the tests that ran. |
| `criteria` | Success-criterion verdict per task group that ran (see below). Absent when no such group ran. |

##### Test scoring

A test declares everything the suite knows about it at its own definition:

```crystal
scored_task "sysctls", emoji: "🔓🔑" do |t, args|          # an ordinary test
  ...
end

scored_task "liveness",
  type: CNFManager::TestType::Essential,                  # counts toward cert
  emoji: "⎈🧫" do |t, args|
  ...
end
```

The **type** decides the point value — `essential` 100, `normal` 5, `bonus` 1 —
so no test restates its own score, and every essential test is by definition a
certification test. `normal` is the default, so only the tests carrying a policy
decision say anything about their type. Everything else is read back rather than declared: a test's
**scope** from the namespace it registers in, and its **category** from the
aggregate that runs it. Individual `pass:`/`fail:` overrides exist for the rare
test that needs one.

There is no `points.yml`. The suite used to write one into the working directory
and read it straight back, so it needed a writable directory to read data it was
compiled with, and edits to the file were silently reverted on the next run.

##### Group success criteria

Every task group — the suites (`all`, `workload`, `cert`) and the
categories (`security`, `configuration`, ...) —
declares a success criterion in `Points::GROUP_CRITERIA`. These are group-level
policy — what the suite certifies, and what it demands of each category — so
they live together in one table:

```crystal
suite_task "cert", [...],
  scope: "essential",     # whose tests count
  min_passed: 15,         # how many of them must pass
  max_failed: CNFManager::NO_FAILURE_LIMIT   # the threshold accounts for failures
```

A group passes when **every** threshold it declares holds:

| threshold | default | meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `min_passed` | `0` | at least this many tests in scope passed |
| `min_ratio` | none | at least this share of the tests that **exist** in scope passed |
| `max_failed` | `0` | at most this many failed; `NO_FAILURE_LIMIT` for no limit |

`min_ratio` counts against how many tests are declared in scope rather than how
many a run reached, because excluding tests shrinks the latter — and `cert`
takes an `exclude` argument, so a ratio over it could be met by running less.

With the defaults — no floor, no ratio, no failures tolerated — a group passes
when nothing in it failed, which is what these groups have always demanded.
Only `cert` declares anything else.

Each evaluated group is recorded under `summary.criteria` in evaluation order:

```yaml
summary:
  criteria:
    - group: security
      scope: security
      min_passed: 0
      max_failed: 0
      passed_count: 17
      max_passed: 19
      failed_count: 2
      passed: false
```

A group's dependencies run before its body, so the **last** entry is the
outermost group, and its verdict is what `exit_code` reflects.

The same verdict is printed to stdout in a stable, greppable form:

```
Security: FAILED (2 of 19 tests failed)
Certification: PASSED (17 of 19 essential tests passed, threshold 15)
```

##### `items[]` fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Test name (e.g. `privileged_containers`). |
| `status` | `passed`, `failed`, `skipped`, `na`, or `error`. |
| `message` | One-line verdict for the test. |
| `type` | The test's declared type (`essential`, `normal`, `bonus`). |
| `points` | Points awarded for this test. |
| `start_time` / `end_time` | RFC 3339 timestamps for the test's start and end. |
| `task_runtime` | Test duration in seconds (number). |
| `details` | *(optional)* Free-form reason/evidence strings; omitted when empty. |
| `remediation` | *(optional)* Guidance on how to fix the failure; omitted when empty. A failed test that provides none of its own carries the *Remediation* section of its entry in [TEST_DOCUMENTATION](docs/TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md). |
| `impacted_resources` | *(optional)* Structured list of offending resources; omitted when empty. |

Each `impacted_resources` entry has `kind` and `name`, plus optional `namespace`, `container`, `pod`, and `reason` (present only when known).

### Logging Parameters

- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_LOG_LEVEL** environment variable: sets minimal log level to display: error (default); info; debug.
- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_LOG_PATH** environment variable: if set - all logs would be appended to the file defined by that variable.

#### Output streams

Result lines, scores and summaries are the suite's output and go to **stdout**; log messages are
diagnostics and go to **stderr** (or to the `CNTI_TESTSUITE_LOG_PATH` file when set). This means
`./cnti-testsuite <test> > results.txt 2> debug.log` cleanly separates the two even with
`CNTI_TESTSUITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. When capturing the streams separately, their relative ordering is not
guaranteed — merge them with `2>&1` if strict interleaving matters. Cursor-control progress
rewrites and colors are only emitted when stdout is a terminal.

---

### Exit codes

The exit code answers one question: did the invocation do what was asked?

| Code | Meaning | When |
|------|---------|------|
| `0` | Yes | A test run met its objective — for a run with a pass criterion (`cert`) the criterion was met, for any other run no test failed. A setup, install or uninstall command completed. |
| `1` | No | At least one test failed, or the criterion was not met. Or a command could not do its job: a precondition was missing (no kubeconfig, no CNF installed, a CNF already installed, a tool failed to install) or an operation failed. A message says which. |
| `2` | The suite itself broke | A test raised an unexpected exception, or the process crashed outside a test. Always wins over `1`. |
| `64` | Usage error | The command line was wrong: an unknown task, flag or argument; a malformed value; a required argument missing; an argument naming a file that does not exist. Detected before the requested operation starts. (sysexits `EX_USAGE`.) |

A script that only needs pass/fail can test for `0`. A script that wants to tell "the CNF failed" (`1`) apart from "the suite or the invocation is broken" (`2`, `64`) can branch on the code.

### Common Example Commands

#### Building the executable

This is the command to build the binary executable if in developer mode or using the source install method ([requires crystal](INSTALL.md#source-install)):

```
crystal build src/cnti-testsuite.cr
```

#### Validating a cnti-testsuite.yaml file:

```
./cnti-testsuite validate_config --cnf-config [PATH_TO]/cnti-testsuite.yaml
```

#### Installing a cnf:

```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_install --cnf-config ./cnti-testsuite.yaml
```

##### Specify a timeout for resource readiness during installation:
```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_install --cnf-config ./cnti-testsuite.yaml --timeout 1800
```

##### Skip waiting for resource readiness during installation:
```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_install --cnf-config ./cnti-testsuite.yaml --skip-wait-for-install
```

#### Uninstalling a cnf:
```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_uninstall
```

##### Specify timeout for resource removal during uninstallation
```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_uninstall --timeout 60
```

##### Skip waiting for resource removal during uninstallation:
```
./cnti-testsuite cnf_uninstall --skip-wait-for-uninstall
```

#### Running all of the tests:

```
./cnti-testsuite all --cnf-config <path_to_your_config_file>/cnti-testsuite.yaml
```

#### Running all of the tests (including proofs of concepts)

```
./cnti-testsuite all --poc --cnf-config <path_to_your_config_file>/cnti-testsuite.yaml
```

#### Running all of the workload tests

```
crystal src/cnti-testsuite.cr -- workload --cnf-config <path_to_your_config_file>/cnti-testsuite.yaml
```

#### Running certification tests

```
./cnti-testsuite cert
./cnti-testsuite cert --essential
./cnti-testsuite cert --skip increase_decrease_capacity --skip single_process_type
```

#### Running the workload tests:

```
./cnti-testsuite workload
```

#### Get available options and to see all available tests from command line:

`help` prints a usage page: the typical workflow, every option with its
meaning, and how to skip tasks or run several. `-h` and a bare invocation print
the same page.

```
./cnti-testsuite help
./cnti-testsuite -h
```

To list every task, grouped by category:

```
./cnti-testsuite help tasks
```

To see what a single task does, what it runs first, and which suites it belongs
to:

```
./cnti-testsuite help liveness
```

An unknown task name is answered with the closest match, e.g. `./cnti-testsuite
livenes` suggests `liveness`.

#### Shell completion:

`completion` prints a completion script for bash (default) or zsh, generated from the same
task and option registries `help` uses, so it always matches the binary that printed it:
namespaced task paths (`setup:install_kubescape`), every `--option` with its value (file names
after `--cnf-config` and the other path options, task names after `--skip`, `-l` log levels),
and further task names.

```
source <(./cnti-testsuite completion bash)     # this shell only
source <(./cnti-testsuite completion zsh)      # zsh (uses bashcompinit)
```

To make it permanent, add that line to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`, or for bash drop the script
where bash-completion picks it up:

```
./cnti-testsuite completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/cnti-testsuite
```

The script completes the binary name it was generated by (`cnti-testsuite` for the release
binary). To remove it: `complete -r cnti-testsuite`.

#### Print the version:

```
./cnti-testsuite --version
```

#### Clean up the CNTI Test Suite, the K8s cluster, and upstream projects:

```
./cnti-testsuite uninstall_all
```

---

### Logging Options

#### Update the loglevel from command line:

```
# cmd line
./cnti-testsuite -l debug test
```

#### If in developer mode, make sure to use - - if running from source:

```
crystal src/cnti-testsuite.cr -- -l debug test
```

#### You can also use env var for logging:

```
CNTI_TESTSUITE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./cnti-testsuite test
```

:star: Note: When setting log level, the following is the order of precedence:

1. CLI or Command line flag
2. Environment variable
3. CNTi Test Suite [Config file](config.yml) — `./config.yml` in the working directory, else `config.yml` in the suite home (`~/.cnti-testsuite`, relocatable via `CNTI_TESTSUITE_DIR`)

> Note: Available log levels are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warn`, `error` and `fatal`.

#### Environment variables for timeouts:

Timeouts are controlled by these environment variables, set them if default values aren't suitable:
```
CNTI_TESTSUITE_GENERIC_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=60
CNTI_TESTSUITE_RESOURCE_CREATION_TIMEOUT=120
CNTI_TESTSUITE_NODE_READINESS_TIMEOUT=240
CNTI_TESTSUITE_POD_READINESS_TIMEOUT=180
CNTI_TESTSUITE_LITMUS_CHAOS_TEST_TIMEOUT=1800
CNTI_TESTSUITE_NODE_DRAIN_TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION=90
CNTI_TESTSUITE_LABEL_RESOURCE_SLEEP=5
```

#### Network retries:

Network-bound fetches (chart pulls, repo adds, binary downloads) are retried on transient
failures — resets, timeouts, DNS blips, 5xx — while a missing chart or auth error still fails
immediately:

```
CNTI_TESTSUITE_NETWORK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3   # attempts per fetch
CNTI_TESTSUITE_NETWORK_RETRY_BACKOFF=2    # base seconds between attempts (attempt N waits N x backoff)
```

#### Other environment variables:

- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_DIR**: the suite home (default `~/.cnti-testsuite`): where `config.yml` is looked up and where the tools the suite installs for itself are cached under `tools/`. Each cached tool carries a `<tool>.version` marker with the version it was installed at; a suite that pins a different version reinstalls it on the next run, so the cache never serves a stale tool.
- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_FORCE_INSTALL**: set (to any value) to reinstall the suite-managed local Helm even when an installation is already present.
- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_ENV**: set to `TEST` for test-mode shortcuts (smaller samples, quicker checks). Used by the spec suite; not meant for normal runs.
- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_RESULTS_DIR**: redirect the results directory; see [Results file](#results-file).
- **CNTI_TESTSUITE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_SOCKET**: host path of the container runtime socket the LitmusChaos helpers use for `pod_io_stress`. By default the suite detects the runtime from the nodes and probes the usual socket locations (including the k3s, RKE2 and microk8s ones) on a node; set this when the cluster keeps the socket elsewhere. A cluster property, not part of the CNF config.

Every variable that configures the suite's own behavior carries the `CNTI_TESTSUITE_` prefix.
Credentials and ecosystem-wide standards deliberately keep their conventional names, so one
export serves every tool that honors them: `KUBECONFIG`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`/`DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` (shared by `docker login`, `helm registry login`,
and the suite's registry queries — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)), `NO_COLOR`, and `HOME`.

#### Running The Linter

Ameba (https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba) is a static code linter for crystal-lang.
To run Ameba, testsuite needs to be installed in developer mode ([Source Install](INSTALL.md#source-install)) and Ameba needs to be installed using source method, which is mentioned in Ameba readme.md:

```
git clone https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba && cd ameba
make install
```

After that, follow the usage guidelines from the Ameba repository.

### Usage for categories and single tests
